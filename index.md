## Polyhedron Engine:
What started off on a wrong foot with Nail & Crescent, the flagship game we are aiming for, ended up on the right track after a steady ride. I could ramble on and on and write an eternal story about it over here but I won't. It just came to be that I had an old engine name, not in use anymore, and a logo too. How convenient, everybody liked it, and as so.... our fork is called Polyhedron Engine. 

We're aiming towards the community too, as in, hopefully they'll find it interesting, and enjoy certain changes to the workflow which we bring in over time. We're just a year in, but have done some awesome things already.
